<h4><strong><a id="project1" name="project1"></a>'RAW' by Neville Gabie </strong>
</h4>
<h4>Project description</h4>
<p>As the Year Of The Artist in residence for the Forest Of Dean Sculpture Trust, 
Neville Gabie spent a year walking the forest and developing ideas for a programme 
of commission as well as a sculptural work for the forest. Raw emerged from conversations 
with foresters about the trees and one particular fact - that the trees where measured 
annually to calculate their volume and rate of growth. From this Neville asked questions; 
How would that volume look like if you changed its shape? Could you cube up an entire 
tree? What space would the trees absence create in the canopy? Where there other 
ways of measuring or considering the trees dimensions? </p>
<p class="post"><strong>RAW</strong> is a permanent work where the tree, in its 
entirety, from the largest sections of the trunk to the smallest branches was all 
cut into cubes of varying sizes. These were then stacked to create a single cube 
volume of almost 2metres which can be seen in the clearing left by the tree.&nbsp; 
Above is the space in the canopy left by the tree and to the side is the tree stump 
cut close to the ground.</p>
<h4>Temporary work</h4>
<p>From his exploration of the properties of this tree four temporary installations 
emerged:</p>
<p><img height="9" src="/static/images/icon_arrow_sm.gif" width="18" />Earth 
- a whole in the forest floor. A measurement of the total degradable volume of the 
tree the total.</p>
<p><img height="9" src="/static/images/icon_arrow_sm.gif" width="18" />Fire 
- energy generated for a light bulb. A measure of the calorific value of the timber 
in the tree which will be turned into light.</p>
<p><img height="9" src="/static/images/icon_arrow_sm.gif" width="18" />Air 
- annual production of oxygen. A measure of the amount of oxygen this tree would 
convert in a given period - oxygen released into water.</p>
<p class="post">
<img height="9" src="/static/images/icon_arrow_sm.gif" width="18" />Water - 
average amount drawn by a tree from the ground. A measure of the amount of oxygen 
this tree would convert in a given period.</p>

<h4><strong><a id="project2" name="project2"></a>Lightshift (group show)
</strong></h4>
<h4>Project Description</h4>
<p>During an eight week period in September and October 2001, an extraordinary collaboration 
of artists, foresters and students worked intensively to create a light-based performance 
event in the Forest of Dean. 'Lightshift' was the result, an artist-led project 
which aimed to revive interest and bring back confidence in the Forest, closed to 
visitors and residents for 5 months during the foot and mouth outbreak.</p>
<p>Artists Mark Anderson of Blissbody and Robin Blackledge developed a concept and 
body of work for a journey through a section of the Forest of Dean Sculpture Trail. 
Into the trail the artists injected installations of sound, light, projection, fire 
and pyrotechnics that amazed people for seven nights.</p>
<p>'Lightshift' comprised thirty installations including works by Lulu Quinn &amp; Julie Westerman, Tony Sinden, Elise Hurcombe (a young sound artist from the Forest 
of Dean), and David Gibbons from Urban Projects with assistance from students from 
Sheffield University and the University of West of England.</p>
<p class="post">The whole event drew an audience of over 40,000 from all over the 
South West of England. The result was a range of challenging works achieved in a 
limited period of time and in a very unusual environment. Coupled with special excitement 
of the Forest being opened up at night, the work was extremely successful, engaging 
and inspiring the audience, which grew with every performance.</p>

<h4><strong><a id="project3" name="project3"></a>'Diversity' by Erika Tan
</strong></h4>
<h4>Project description</h4>
<p>The commission was to develop a body of work, temporary and permanent, that considered 
culture and diversity within the Forest of Dean. The forest is a unique environment, 
but with a perceived homogeny in terms of culture and identity and has historically 
been quite self-contained. The Trust invited Erika to respond to this, in particular 
the environmental impact of the forest, how such landscapes impact on the local 
culture and how people of different cultures experience the forest. Another area 
of diversity that explored in her work was the issue of biodiversity in the forest. 
At the time of the commission Forest Enterprise had been actively increasing the 
range and diversity of its trees to include broadleaved species to encourage a richer 
forest environment. </p>
<p class="post">Erika Tan also worked in collaboration with forest based visual 
artist and poet Jane Spray.</p>
