<p>InSite Arts curated a programme of installations, by renowned and emerging artists, 
as part of the second and third Westonbirt Festival of the Garden, being held 
at the Forestry Commission's National Arboretum in Gloucestershire.</p>
<p>Collectively the artists all worked with a broad range of media and their backgrounds 
are diverse. The artists were commissioned to explore the relationship between their 
practice and the environment of the Arboretum. Responding to the history and heritage, 
as well as the current natural beauty of the tree collection, the brief was to create 
original installations that challenge visitors' perceptions of the landscape.</p>
<p class="post">Each artist was selected for their commitment to creative research, 
originality, imaginative use of materials and wit. </p>
