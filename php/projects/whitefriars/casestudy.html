<p>InSite Arts and Hazel Colquhoun were appointed to support Land Securities and 
Canterbury City Council in developing a public art strategy for the development 
at Canterbury Whitefriars. Extensive partnership working and liaison with the City Council took 
place to ensure the effective delivery of a range of permanent and temporary works 
of art. </p>
<p class="post">A detailed strategy was developed that embraced the potential of 
permanent work within the scheme but also how a temporary art programme could contribute 
to the awareness raising initiatives about the scheme and to give voices to residents 
and visitors to the city. The temporary programme ran through the life of the development 
and also included four temporary installations by artist Janet Hodgson during the 
research period for her permanent work for the main public space within the development, 
Whitefriars Square.</p>
<h3>The Projects</h3>
<h4><strong>'The Pits' by Janet Hodgson</strong></h4>
<p>Janet&#39;s permanent work celebrates the artistry of archaeology that both records 
and interprets on-site archaeological findings. It consists of sandblasted drawings 
in the york stone paving slabs of Whitefriars Square. The sandblasted drawings are 
exact copies of the stratigraphic archaeological drawings of the pits or holes that 
were found on the site during the excavations, enlarged to full size and positioned 
exactly where they were discovered. The work was developed during more than a year&#39;s 
observations of the archaeological excavation and recording that took place on the 
site. Janet was fascinated not only in what the archaeologists found, but also in 
the detail of the excavation process, what the archaeologists considered important 
and how they &#39;drew&#39; time. She was also struck by the archaeological practice of 
removal - a direct inversion of the normal process of construction.</p>
<p>The drawings reproduced on the paving stones were executed with exacting precision, 
all using the agreed form of notation or language, yet each one retains the hand 
of the person who drew them They serve as permanent reminders of the many dedicated 
and talented individuals who worked on the site. </p>

<h4><strong>'The Lamb' by Kenny Hunter </strong></h4>
<p>The second permanent art installation by Kenny Hunter was installed in St George&#39;s 
Lane in August 2005.The bronze work addresses a diverse range of historical, religious 
and contemporary social currents, through its singular sculptural form - a lamb 
standing on a tree stump. This organic, pastoral composition contrasts strongly 
with its location, a dynamic city centre site. The result is an intimate, tactile 
and ancient form placed within a busy public environment of modernity. Kenny Hunter&#39;s 
inspiration for the work includes William Blake&#39;s &#39;Jerusalem&#39;, the hymn being synonymous 
with English identity and yearning for social justice. Kenny further considers the 
contemporary social condition that sees England reassess and adjust itself to a 
rapidly changing political and social environment and what being English means at 
the beginning of the 21st century.</p>

<h3>Temporary Programme</h3>
<h4><strong>Grennan &amp; Sperandio</strong></h4>
<p>Simon Grennan and Christopher Sperandio produced ten iconic portraits of real 
people representing the diversity of social lives around the Whitefriars Development, 
focussing particularly on personal experiences and points of view of the range of 
types of people who live and work in the area. They were produced using Grennan 
&amp; Sperandio&#39;s trade-mark cartoon style and were art-directed by each local participant.</p>
<p>These images were painted temporarily onto ten shop and trader windows around 
the Whitefriars development. A hand-leafleting campaign around the city centre promoted 
the work. The series of portraits appeared for four weeks.</p>

<h4><strong>'Holy Mackerel' by Susan Collins</strong></h4>
<p>Holy Mackerel by Susan Collins was the first temporary public installation commissioned. 
The work consisted of a series of 5 stereo video &#39;viewfinders&#39; which were placed 
at various locations around the perimeter of the Whitefriars site, embedded as eyeholes 
into the hoardings. Using a technique developed by the artist, first used in &#39;Viewfinder&#39; 
(2000) passersby could view a 3d (stereo) video version of &#39;events&#39; beyond the hoarding 
- creating a 3 dimensional &#39;window&#39; into the site from a range of vantage points 
The work functioned 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, automatically switching between 
the day and night views. By day the &#39;views&#39; were a straightforward replaying of 
events as seen (and filmed) from the same physical vantage point, the 3d effect 
giving a hyper or heightened sense of the &#39;real&#39;.</p>
<p>The daytime scenes included builders using diggers and pile drivers; people walking 
to and from the onsite canteen and the archaeologists artwork on the &#39;big dig&#39;.</p>
<p>After dark the &#39;views&#39; were of the site after the builders had gone home, and 
on occasion the viewer may have caught a glimpse of something &#39;else&#39; on site. These 
glimpses were constructed as rare and varied occurrences - intended to be entertaining 
and seasonal as well as surprising. The intention was to encourage the viewer to 
return to the work at different times and in different locations, and for the work 
to always offer the promise of a fresh experience.</p>

<h4><strong>'Shopping' by Susan Shaw</strong></h4>
<p>Canterbury based artist, Susan Shaw, created 'Shopping', a project that delved 
into the interface between consumerism and religion. The installation in Eastbridge 
Hospital's 'Undercroft' filled the entire floor with a carpet of ecclesiastical 
purple, luxuriously manufactured, shopping bags, embossed with a silver W and placed 
in rows like church pews throughout the old pilgrims resting rooms. Each silver 
logo branded on the bags, seemingly resembled a bishop's mitre (or perhaps a hint 
at the 'W' of Whitefriars shopping), making poignant references to both the spiritual 
and consumer cultures of Canterbury, and in turn offering different interpretations 
for visiting audiences. As one visitor commented;</p>
<p><em>Consumerism is God - Tesco the temple - But art confronts and gives us a 
more precious truth</em>.</p>
<p>On the closing day of exhibition, Susan opened the 'Everything Must Go' sale 
where queues of shoppers spilled out onto the high street waiting to own an art 
collectors 'must-have' bargain. Over 1000 bags, individually numbered and signed 
by the artist, were picked-up by 'shoppers' at the sale. Not only taking part in 
a little retail therapy, shoppers were left to take away the ultimate decision - 
is this bag to be used as the latest, limited edition accessory? Or should it be 
treasured as the original, sacred piece of artwork?</p>

<h4><strong>Marion Kalmus</strong></h4>
<p>Marion's work sought to capture the imagination of the people who live and shop 
in Canterbury. Through a participatory process that ran for a few weeks during the 
Autumn 2003 Marion encouraged people to talk about the new development and their 
feelings about the changing city. Her tool for discussion was the notion of an Idiom 
a well known saying - with popular meaning - but actually referred to something 
quite different to its literal meaning</p>
<p>'Get up and Go' was chosen and the location, a building due for demolition. The 
chosen Idiom related to both the metaphorical progress of the city change, and the 
literal fate of the building on which it stood.</p>
<p>Each letter stood over 13m high, was illuminated at night and remained in situ 
until the building was demolished. </p>
