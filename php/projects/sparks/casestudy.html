<p>Curated and project-managed by Sarah Collicott of InSite Arts, Sparks was a temporary 
programme of three new media and light based commissions. The programme sought to 
animate three quite different townscapes during the winter nights 2005 - Whitstable, 
Herne Bay and Canterbury. </p>
<p>Sparks began through a competitive process, eight artists being invited to develop 
concept proposals.</p>
<p class="post">The works ranged from a large scale projection project 'Gatefold' 
by Anna Heinrich and Leon Palmer, to intimate neon installations generated by drawings 
of local residents of Herne Bays' dream destinations 'Bay Windows' by Vong Phaophanit 
and Claire Oboussier. In sharp contrast, Claire Morgan's huge domestic light bulb 
which was suspended on the dockside in Whitstable, glowing and flickering for two 
months.</p>
