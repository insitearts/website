<p><strong>Jane Watt</strong> was commissioned by Land Securities to work with their 
landscape architects and Architects, Panter Hudspith to develop a work within the 
Christ's Lane Development. The work is a long wall of glass. Entitled 'Wall of Letters' 
the work consists of approximately 100 glass panels and will incorporate almost 
32,000 letters in total, creating a monumental word-search. </p>

<p>The artist writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the main concepts for the wall was to create an artwork 
that is built up from different people's associations and experiences of the area. 
Each time a person looks at the wall they might find a different word. It will provide 
a unique experience for each viewer, with some finding a few words and others constructing 
more complicated stories. Every viewing will be different, adding an element of 
intrigue to the wall.</p></blockquote>
