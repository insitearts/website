<p>The building of four new commercial buildings, The World Business Centre, Heathrow, 
that accommodates airport related business, generated two exciting opportunities 
for artists to create permanent works in the foyer spaces. <br />
Architects: Bennetts Associates.</p>
<p><strong>John Newling's</strong> permanent work 'Duration of a Wish' is a sculptural 
work, a photographic installation and a performance that took place at the launch 
of the work.</p>

<p>A second video work and sound installation was created by <strong>Matthew Dalziel</strong> 
and <strong>Louise Scullion</strong>. Two monitors display footage of an endless 
sea journey whilst all around birdcalls of migratory birds pan across the main atrium.</p>
