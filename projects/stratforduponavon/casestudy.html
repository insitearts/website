<p class="post">InSite Arts advised and supported the Streetscape Improvements Group 
of the District Council to appoint an artist to work in a series of the main streets 
in the town centre. The commission was challenging for the artist as the new public 
realm had been completed and the art work was to be developed retrospectively. In 
her work 'Saturday 18th March' Janet Hodgson created a discreet and permanent intervention 
onto the streets of Stratford upon Avon. The work records a selection of events 
that the artist witnessed during a visit on Saturday 18th March 2000. </p>
<blockquote><p class="post"><em>The transcriptions of these actions are sandblasted into the 
pavements exactly where they took place, the actions have no significance but are 
just simply happenings. The apparent banality is deliberate in a direct opposition 
to the most public art which is often a commemoration of an event or of a life of 
someone considered significant. There is a link within the work to the Theatre, 
by providing maps or 'scripts of the events'.</em><br />
