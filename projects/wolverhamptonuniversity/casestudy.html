<p>InSite Arts was appointed to assist the University of Wolverhampton 
to fulfill their planning obligations resulting from Wolverhampton City Council's 
Percent for Art Policy. The commission was initiated near to completion of the development 
and this offered to the artists exceptional challenges to make a work integral to 
the building with little potential for changes to building specifications. Lulu 
Quinn and Julie Westerman rose to the challenge and create an interactive work, 
utilising steam and light to reflect the temperature of the building.</p>

<p class="post">The work consists of twenty stainless steel pipes set in a row along 
the zinc facade below a two storey glass window. The pipes contain animated white 
light and emit illuminated puffs of white steam that are programmed to reflect on 
the academic, social, cultural and environmental temperature creating an animated 
light and water display running through all twenty pipes.</p>
