<p>InSite Arts worked with the project design team to develop a programme of work 
that contributed to both the public realm and the built environment. In all cases 
the artists invited to work on the development were selected due to their commitment 
to in-depth research and a genuine interest in the Exeter and the particular sites 
within which they were to work.</p>
<p class="post">Each of the artists&#39; work celebrated the historical importance of 
the city and supported the contemporary vision laid out in the development&#39;s original 
masterplan, primarily to open vistas and create permeable streetscapes. All the 
work was created in partnership with the specialist design practices working on 
the development - architects, landscape architects and lighting designers.</p>
<h3>The artworks</h3>
<h4><strong>&#39;The Exeter Traceries&#39; by Katayoun Dowlatshahi</strong></h4>
<p>
<img alt="Katayoun Dowlatshahi" class="border" height="251" src="The-Exeter-Traceries_13.jpg" width="400" /></p>
<p>At the heart of the development is a new public square. Designed as a continental-style 
piazza featuring cafes and restaurants, the area has become a focus for eating and 
dining in the city. A glass pavilion, which houses two new restaurants forms the 
centrepiece of the square, and is also the site of one of the development&#39;s most 
exciting public art commissions. </p>
<p>Six glass panels, each measuring 4137 mm by 1748 mm, have been installed on the 
facade of the pavilion featuring the work of Iranian-born British artist Katayoun 
Dowlatshahi. Inspired by the sacred architecture of Exeter Cathedral, and its close 
proximity behind the square, the artist has created a series of &#39;windows&#39; which 
echo the notion of a medieval rood screen. In the same way that cathedral windows 
are intended as apertures to heavenly bodies as well as being focal points for personal 
contemplation, the glass panels bring to a secular space the opportunity for peaceful 
reflection while at the same time emphasising the ephemeral nature of light.</p>
<p>The cathedral is a living monument and the glass pavilion is, by association, 
a rood screen obscuring and simultaneously revealing this sacred space. The designs 
appearing on each glass panel, applied through a process of hot enamelling and silk 
screening, also carry references to the city&#39;s network of medieval subterranean 
aqueducts.</p>

<h4><strong>&#39;Marking Time&#39; by Patricia MacKinnon-Day</strong></h4>
<p>

<p>As part of this major programme of public art in and around Princesshay, Patricia 
MacKinnon-Day was commissioned to create a permanent installation on the site of 
the historically important Almshouses in Catherine Street. Constructed in 1450, 
the Almhouses have recently undergone structural repair and enhancements following 
an initiative by Land Securities, Exeter City Council and English Heritage to create 
an improved setting for one of Exeter&#39;s most historic landmarks. </p>
<p>The work created by Patricia MacKinnon-Day, entitled &#39;Marking Time&#39;, provides 
an explanation of the buildings&#39; history, and consists of the recreation of the 
lost doors which would have originally been part of the Almshouses. These take the 
form of free-standing arched doors made of glass, and are sited in the precise location 
of where the doors were originally situated. Copied from the medieval designs of 
the Almshouses, these doors are illuminated to showcase archaeological finds from 
the site, encased within the glass. Other elements of the installation include rows 
of still and flickering votive lights filling the chapel space, with texts from 
the historic Chapter Acts books, describing the lives of medieval occupants, etched 
into the paving.</p>

<h4><strong>&#39;In Memory Exeter 1942&#39; by Roger Dean</strong></h4>
<p>This new work by Exeter-based sculptor Roger Dean incorporates a wall of curved<br />
stainless steel with two highly detailed bronze reliefs. The front relief, within 
the concave of the sculpture, was originally created by Roger for his memorial fountain 
located in the city centre. Land Securities invited Roger to revisit his work when 
it became apparent, during development of Princesshay, that his original fountain 
would not survive relocation.</p>
<p>The new bronze and steel sculptural work is located within Broadwalk House Gardens 
in Southernhay. The inspiration for two bronze reliefs, as with the original fountain, 
was from the photographic records taken the day after the bombardment of Exeter 
in May 1942. These reliefs are encapsulated in a steel sculptural wall that creates 
a new focal point in the gardens, which aims to offer the busy users of the city 
a place for a moment&#39;s respite and contemplation.</p>

<h4><strong>&#39;ancient+modern I and II&#39; and &#39;Riverwalk&#39; by Patrick Shanahan</strong></h4>
<p><img class="border" height="267" src="Shanahan-Exeter-130.jpg" width="400" /></p>
<p>The temporary photographic commission was awarded to regionally based Patrick 
Shanahan, and was exhibited in and around Exeter and the development site during 
the construction programme. Patrick chose to investigate the contemporary &#39;cultural 
landscape&#39; and capture moments of Exeter perhaps long taken for granted or no longer 
easily accessible. The &#39;ancient+modern&#39; images revealed the juxtaposition of a modern 
developing city with the old and historically rich foundations of Exeter. By contrast, 
Patrick&#39;s commission for the Paris Street hoardings, &#39;Riverwalk&#39;, was based around 
a series of walks taken along the River Exe, from Exeter&#39;s Quayside to Exmouth in 
the east and then across to Dawlish, west of the city.</p>
<p>&#39;The images displayed in Paris Street are not chronologically ordered. They are 
sequenced to convey the experience of walking through the landscape unconsciously 
taking in the views in a haphazard way, as your eyes wander from a general view 
to a detailed view&#39;</p>
<p class="post">Patrick&#39;s exquisite photographs convert otherwise recognisable urban 
landscapes into reworked places which have both a strong, evocative capacity and 
a sense of artificiality about them. In blurring the distinction between reality 
and imagination, Shanahan&#39;s photographs manage to alter the way we see.</p>
