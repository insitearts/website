<p class="post">InSite Arts were appointed in 2006 to work with Hammerson's project 
team to develop a small programme of commission for the Highcross Quarter's development. 
Each work was conceived to be integral part of the new development. The artworks 
all assume a natural presence within its given location and, at the same time, give 
Highcross Quarter another means of expressing its unique identity.</p>

<p class="post">The courtyard area of the new restaurant quarter, located off the 
public piazza, is home to a 20 metre sculptural installation by <strong>Jacqui Poncelet</strong>. 
The work will act as an architectural screen to close off views of the courtyard 
from the car park on Freeschool Lane. </p>
<p>Photographer <strong>Jason Orton</strong> has been commissioned to interpret 
the transformation taking place around Highcross Quarter. His work, a photographic 
journey through time, will make references to the site's history and consider the 
relationship between the new development and the wider Leicester community.</p>
<p class="post">Work will be open to the public from September 5th 2008.</p>
